# Realtime database

The realtime module is responsible to propagate database changes to the concerned clients in realtime. The clients execute a `liveQuery` which is similar to a normal query with a where clause. The realtime module makes sure that whenever there is any change in the result set (results get added, removed or updated), the client will be updated.

## How it works?

The realtime module guarantees that all changes will propagate to the client irrespective of failures on the backend. To achieve these guarantees, Space Cloud uses [Apache Kafka](https://apache.kafka.org) under the hood.

However, Space Cloud doesn't use Kafka by default. It uses Kafka ony when the `PROD` environment variable is set to true or when `space-cloud` is started with the `--prod` flag.

> **Note:** The distributed mode of realtime module is not implemented yet.

## Limitations

There are a few limitations in the queries which can be used while using the realtime module.

- The primary key must be `_id` in case of MongoDB and `id` for MySQL and Postgres and of type `text`, `varchar` or `string`.
- All documents to be inserted must have the `_id` (for MongoDB) or `id` (for MySQL and Postgres) fields set.
- The fields used in the where clause of `liveQuery` should not be updated by another request.
- All updates and deletes can be made on a single document only using the `_id` or `id` field in the where clause.

## Enable the realtime module

The configuration pertaining to the realtime module can be found under the `realtime` key under the `modules` object. Here's a snippet showing how to **enable the realtime module**. This 3 line snippet will set up all the necessary routines required by the realtime module.

```yaml
modules:
  realtime:
    enabled: true     # Enable the realtime module globally
    kafka: localhost  # Connection string for kafka

# Config for other modules go here 
```

You also need to to enable the feature on the collections you want to sync. Here's a snippet which indicates that the collection `todos` is realtime.

```yaml
modules:
  crud:
    mongo:
      conn: mongodb://localhost:27017
      isPrimary: true
      collections:
        todos:
          isRealtimeEnabled: true   # This makes the todos collection realtime
          rules:
            create:
              rule: allow
            read:
              rule: allow
            update:
              rule: allow
            delete:
              rule: allow
  realtime:
    enabled: true     # Enable the realtime module globally
    kafka: localhost

  # Config for other modules go here 
```

## Next steps

That's all you need to do to enable the realtime module. It's time to go ahead and how to use the realtime module on the frontend.
