# Access custom logic
You can call a function running on the backend (written via functions module of Space Cloud) on frontend by simply calling `api.call` on frontend. Here's a code snippet showing how to do it:

```js
import { API } from "space-api";

// Initialize api with the project name and url of the space cloud
const api = new API("todo-app", "http://localhost:8080");

// Call a function running 'my-func' of 'my-engine' running on backend
api.call('my-engine', 'my-func', { msg: 'Space Cloud is awesome!' }, 1000)
  .then(res => {
    if (res.status === 200) {
      console.log('Response: ', res.data)
    }
  }).catch(ex => {
    // Exception occured while processing request
  })
```

The `call` function takes four arguments which are as follows:
- **engineName** - Name of the engine
- **funcName** - Name of the function
- **params** - An object that can contain any data that you want to pass to the function on backend
- **timeOut** - Timeout in seconds

As you would have noticed, the above function is asynchronous in nature. 

## Response

A response object sent by the server contains the **status** and **data** fields explained below:

**status:** Number describing the status of the operation. Following values are possible:
- 200 - Operation was successful
- 500 - Internal server error

**data:** Object returned by the function.
